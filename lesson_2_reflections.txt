What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

>The hidden folder .git is created. It contains the history of the committed 
>files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

>The staging area contains the files which will be committed with the next
>commit. Whereas the working directory contains all files and the repository
>only contains committed files. The staging area allows to selectively commit
>files from the working directory.
