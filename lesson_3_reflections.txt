When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

>To collaborate with other people, to make my work public or to have a security 
copy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

>When several people are working simultaneously on the same files, a continuous
>update of my local copy could corrupt my work since the file changes while I
>work with it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

>A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub. Instead of cloning and pushing a
>repository, the repository is copied directly on the GitHub server. This 
>process involves less work and gives credit to the original creator of the 
>forked repository. 
>A clone is a local copy of a remote repository.
>Branches are paths along which file changes are committed. They allow to 
>develop features independently from the master branch. Later the can be merged
>into another branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

>In case of no internet connection all recent changes made to the remote 
>repository would be present in the local repository. These changes can be
>compared to the master branch or merged into it.
